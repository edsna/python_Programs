#PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
#This program Prompts a user to input the number of Pets they have, creates an ordered list of those Pets naming each of them in order in a new file
#and finally prints a nice list of those Pets.

#Creating an empty list and prompting for the number of pets
PetList = []
NumOfPets = input("Enter the number of Pets you have: ")

#Selecting PetNames File's range, creating on it a variable called PetList and appending or adding a user's names of Pets onto the PetList's list
def getPetNames(PetNames):
    global PetList
    for Pet in range(0,PetNames):
        NameOfPets = raw_input("Enter the name of your Pets: ")
        PetList.append(NameOfPets)
getPetNames(NumOfPets)
 
#Saving the names of the Pets onto PetNames file and closing it.
def SavePetNames(PetNames):
    Names = open(PetNames, "w")
    for item in PetList:
        Names.write(item)
    Names.close()
SavePetNames ("PetNames.txt")

#Calling the variable PetList and printing all of it's items
def PrintList():
    global PetList
    for items in PetList:
        print items

PrintList()
